    <para id="id15253803">S. Ramanujan</para>
    <para id="id17999240">The great Indian mathematician, S. Ramanujan has left the sign of his brilliance in various fields of mathematics like Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Number theory etc. throughout his entire life. He has also made some extraordinary contributions to the fields like Hypergeometric series, Elliptic functions, Prime numbers, Bernoulli`s numbers, Divergent series, Continued fractions, Elliptic Modular equations, Highly Composite numbers, Riemann Zeta functions, Partition of numbers, Mock-Theta functions etc. Actually, apart from a few elementary ones, most of the contributions of S. Ramanujan belong to a higher realm of mathematics that is often referred to as "Higher Mathematics". In fact, one can find it quite difficult to understand S. Ramanujan`s mathematics if he does not have the basic foundation in various mathematical subjects. </para>

    <para id="id15302422">The <emphasis effect="bold">Saha ionization equation</emphasis>, also known as the <emphasis effect="bold">Saha-Langmuir equation</emphasis>, was developed by the famous Indian astrophysicist Megh Nad Saha in 1920, and later (1923) by Irving Langmuir. One of the important applications of the equation was in explaining the spectral classification of stars. The equation is a result of combining ideas of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. </para>

    <para id="id20436410">"The impetus given to astrophysics by Saha’s work can scarcely be overestimated, as nearly all later progress in this field has been influenced by it and much of the subsequent work has the character of refinements of Saha’s ideas." - S. Rosseland[4] </para>
    <para id="id20436414">"He (Saha) was extremely simple, almost austere, in his habits and personal needs. Outwardly, he sometimes gave an impression of being remote, matter of fact, and even harsh, but once the outer shell was broken, one invariably found in him a person of extreme warmth, deep humanity, sympathy and understanding; and though almost altogether unmindful of his own personal comforts, he was extremely solicitous in the case of others. It was not in his nature to placate others. He was a man of undaunted spirit, resolute determination, untiring energy and dedication." - D. S. Kothari </para>

    <para id="id15703346">(8 October 1922 - 7 April 2001) is widely acknowledged as one of the most important Indian scientists of the 20th century, best known for his work that led to his creation of the Ramachandran plot for understanding peptide structure. He was the first to propose a triple-helical model for the structure of collagen. He also made other major contributions in biology and physics. </para>
    <para id="id13735440">Professor Ramachandran was born in the town of Ernakulam, Kerala, India. He joined the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1942 in the Electrical Engineering Department. Gopalasamudram, the native place of his forefathers, is a village in the old Tirunelveli District of Madras Presidency. Quickly realizing his interest in physics, he switched to the Department of Physics to complete his master's and doctoral thesis under the supervision of Nobel laureate Sir C. V. Raman. In 1942 he received a master's degree in physics from Madras University with his thesis submitted from Bangalaore (he did not attend any Madras college at that time). He subsequently received his D.Sc. degree in 1947.[1] Here he mostly studied crystal physics and crystal optics. During his studies he created an X-ray focusing mirror for the X-ray microscope. The resulting field of crystal topography is used extensively in studies involving crystal growth and solid-state reactivity. </para>
    <para id="id18995781">Ramachandran then spent two years (1947–1949) at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, where he earned his Ph.D. for 'studies on X-ray diffuse scattering and its application to determination of elastic constants' under the direction of Professor Wiiliam Alfred Wooster, popularly known as W.A. Wooster, a leading crystollagraphy expert in the world. </para>

    <para id="id16794562">(S. Chandrashekhar. By Kameshwar Wali, Imperial College Press , 1997)</para>
    <para id="id18294698">Subrehmanyam Chandrashekher was an austere, diligent and patient scientist and a very humane person. He was born in 1910. In 1930 he sailed to Cambridge University, England. While in the ship , he worked out the fate of collapsing stars. Stars less than 1.4M<sub>Ө</sub> after burning out their nuclear fuel collapses into white dwarf where electrons are tightly packed to their spatial limit and develop degeneracy pressure which halts further collapse. But stars heavier than 1.4M<sub>Ө </sub>overcome this degeneracy pressure and collapse into neutron star. Chandrashekher had correctly predicted that Supernova remnant will be a neutron star.</para>
    <para id="eip-443">Ralph Fowler used Fermi-Dirac Satistics to explain the degeneracy pressure of electrons which helps prevent further collapse of White Dwarf after the fusion reaction fuel is exhausted. Fowler calculated that for a given composition, matter density of white dwarf was proportional to square of the mass. But this led to the impossible propostion that if the mass of a dying star (where all the hydrogen has ben used up) was 1.4Mo (where Mo is the mass of our Sun) or greater, then density tends to become infinity. </para><para id="eip-249">S. Chandrashekher used Special Theory of Relativity to explain the state of matter if the mass of the dying star exceeded 1.4Mo and concluded that if star is heavier than 1.4Mo then super-nova explosion takes place and the star collapses into neutron star and the degeneracy pressure of neutrons prevents the further collapse of the netron star.</para><para id="id16398374">In 1935, he presented his finding to Royal Astronomical Society but his own mentor and research guide Arthur Eddington denounced as Stellar Buffonery. S. Chandrashekher was dejected and crest fallen. He moved to an Academic Position in Chicago University in the year 1937. In 1939 he published his monograph on Stellar Structure including his findings on neutron star.</para>
    <para id="eip-19">In 1939 J. Robert Oppenheimer and his student Hartland Snyder wrote a joint paper “On Continued Gravitational Collapse”. In this paper General Theory of Relativity was applied to explain the state of matter and it was given the name of  Black Hole. It was conjectured that if star is heavier than 3Mo then even the neutron degeneracy does not stop the collapse. Now matter is a newer form called Black Hole which leads to countering the gravitational collapse.</para><para id="eip-552">It was clearly shown that there was no such thing as peaceful equilibrium. The criteria of equilibrium was continuously changing. We are essentially in a violent world.</para><para id="eip-261">Fritz Zwicky observed supernove explosions and identified them as the explosions which dying stars experience when Mass of the star exceeds 1.4Mo. When mass is below 1.4Mo then it experiences only nova explosion. Supernova exploding stars were regarded as standard candle for measuring the distances of galaxies. Fritz Zwicky also recognized the dark matter whose gravitation dominates the dynamics of large scale structure.</para><para id="eip-90">Arthur Edington and Edward Arthur Milne rejected Chandrashekeher’s conjecture of 1.4Mo.
Similarly Edwin Huble and Walter Baade a close colleague of Fritz Zwicky rejected the conjecture of Zwicky that of a violent Universe.
But finally both S.Chandrashekher and Zwicky were vindicated. 
</para><para id="id17330552">In 40’s S. Chandrashekher offered a course on elementary particles for Yerkes University for which he used to drive down 100miles from Chicago University. But his class in this course consisted of only two students. He considered this worth the effort and eventually in 1957 his belief was vindicated. His both the students Chen Ning Yang &amp; Tsung Dao Lee shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their penetrating investigations in the parity laws. The Universe is just wee bit asymmetrical as a result there are instances of parity law violations. This has far reaching consequences for Elementary Particle Physics.</para>
    <para id="id15336969">1960’s saw further vindication of S. Chandrashekher when in 1967 first PULSARS were detected. Discovery of PULSARS made Arthur Eddington eat a humble pie.</para>
    <para id="id16846935">In 1961 S. Chandrashekher started work on General Theory of Relativity. In 1982 his authoritative treatise on Black Holes was published. 1983 saw his ultimate vindication when he shared Nobel Prize in Physics with William A.Fowler. S. Chandrashekher won his laurels for his original doctoral dissertation in 1930 which established Chandrashekher Limit 1.4MӨ. Fowler won his award for his theory of Nucleosynthesis of elements. </para>
