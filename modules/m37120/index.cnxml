    <para id="id1170978511352">During this part of the approach the processor would normally be almost 85% loaded. The extra 6400 cycle steals per second added the equivalent of 13% load, leaving just enough time for all scheduled tasks to run to completion. Five minutes into the descent Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command 1668 which instructed it to calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude). This added an additional 10% to the processor workload causing executive overflow and a 1202 alarm. After being given the "GO" from Houston Aldrin entered 1668 again and another 1202 alarm occurred. When reporting the second alarm Aldrin added the comment "It appears to come up when we have a 1668 up". Happily for <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11</link> the AGC software had been designed with priority scheduling. Just as it had been designed to do, the software automatically recovered, deleting lower priority tasks including the 1668 display task, to complete its critical guidance and control tasks. Guidance controller <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bales">Steve Bales</link> and his support team that included <link url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Garman">Jack Garman</link> issued several "GO" calls and the landing was successful.
